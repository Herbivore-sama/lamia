//This ending only happens if the h-scene has not been unlocked - the protagonist doesn't love the heroine enough to give his life for her


[protagonist] HEY! OVER HERE! 
[narrator] I launched the flare. 
The ship saw us and started turning. 
As they got closer, I made out a flag and a few big guns.
[protagonist] Whoa, that's a U.S. destroyer! Wonder what it's doing out here.
[protagonist's friend] Dude, really? That's awesome. I wish my eyesight wasn't so bad.
[narrator] The ship pulled in to our little bay and sent a longboat ashore.
The men looked heavily armed; I was a little nervous, but still confident.
[protagonist - to heroine, hiding in bush] You have to be careful not to startle them. Don't come out until I tell you to,  OK?
[narrator] She nodded.
[narrator] The men reached the shore, and I hailed them. 
Everything was going smoothly, until suddenly (heroine) charged out of the bush hissing  loudly.
It seems she upset some bird that had made its home there - it was perched on her  head, pecking her, quite a comical sight under any other circumstances. 
The soldiers had a different impression.
A half-woman, half-snake was charging at them, hissing, with bared fangs in a vicious snarl.
You can imagine the fright.
They immediately pointed their weapons at her, demanding that she stop, but...
I never had the time to teach (heroine) English, and she had no idea wha a gun was.
[TRACK] Sad and despairing, loud and chaotic, "all hope is lost" feel, piano only
[protatonist] Wait, don't sh-
[CG]
[narrator] It was too late. The muzzles flashed, and (heroine) dropped to the sand.
[protagonist] no... NO!
[narrator] I ran up to her. She was still squirming around, the way a snake writhes when you cut off its head.
[CG] From protagonist's view, protagonist holding heroine on the ground, hand supporting her head, other arm behind her back, heroine has been shot between the eyes, tongue lolling, eyes wide in fear, rolled up into the back of her head; two more shots in her chest
[narrator] I went numb. I felt nothing. All I could do was hold her.
[CG] fade to black
...
[TRACK] Sad and despairing, but peaceful; a "we'll see each other again someday" feel
[CG] View from behind protagonist, protagonist standing on ship's bow, looking out over water at mainland American port
[narrator] Although I was still mourning, I decided to go along with the plan. 
After what happened, the tribe wasn't quite as willing as they were before, but they soon decided it was for the best.
It's what she would have wanted.
[CG] fade to black
[narrator] Right?
