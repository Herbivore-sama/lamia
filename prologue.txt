[TRACK] everyday pleasantries
[CG] Marine bio lab, detail isn't important here, go wild as long as it looks like a bio lab
[SFX] bubbles (fishtanks)
[narrator] Another comfortable day. And they told me life in America would be hard.
[SCENE] random coworker enters, doesn't matter what he looks like
[coworker] Oi, (protagonist), boss wants to see you.
[protagonist] Alright, on my way.
...
[CG] stairway, then office, perfectly neat, with harsh white lighting
[protagonist] You wanted to see me, sir?
[CG] Stout, portly man, small moustache, dressed in a lab coat over a button-down with a tie and slacks,  cheerful expression
[boss] Ah, (protagonist), yes. I have a... request to make.
You see, the team down in California is undermanned, and -
[protagonist] Stop stop stop. The answer's no. I hate hot weather more than anything.
[boss] I figured you'd say that.
As such, I've taken countermeasures.
You're one of the best guys I've got, so I won't force you to go, but there's half a million in it for you if you do.
[protagonist] five hundred?!
[boss] Assuming, of course, you actually find what we're looking for.
[protagonist] Which is...?
[boss] We're not sure.
[narrator] Awesome.
You'll know it when you see it, though.
[narrator] That makes things so much easier.
[protagonist] And how long do we have?
[boss] Six months. I'm predicting you'll only need two at most. 
According to reports, we're dealing with something weird.
[protagonist] How weird?
[boss] ...weird.
[narrator] Something weird, and I'll know it when I see it. 
Probably a new species of invisible jellyfish. 
Still, five hundred grand,  for less than two months...
I could get a car with that, and have plenty left to boot. 
No more shitty rides in on the train.
[protagonist] Alright, you got me. What and when.
[TRACK] "victory" - bright and bouncy, mocking tones
[CG] boss smiles
[boss] You'll be leaving next Monday.
[narrator] Great way to spend my twentieth birthday; on a plane taking me somewhere hot and humid. During my favorite season, no less.
[boss] Once you arrive, the work'll be pretty much what you do here, just... 
on a boat.
They'll probably have you in the water a bit, but nothing too exciting.
[narrator] Lovely.
[protagonist] Any equipment I'll need?
[boss] Your favorite scalpel and a bathing suit. Everything else'll be on the boat.
[protagonist] And the plane ticket?
[boss] Already paid for.
[protagonist] I'll go say my goodbyes then. 
[narrator] Not that it matters or anything.
I turned to leave.
[CG] boss out of view
[boss] (protagonist)...
[CG] boss back in view, concerned expression
Watch your back out there.
There's a reason you're getting so much for this.
When I said weird, I meant weird.
[protagonist] ...
I'll keep that in mind.
[narrator] I've actually never seen the man so serious before.
[CG] stairs
[narrator] Crap.
This is bad.
...
I'm actually interested.
