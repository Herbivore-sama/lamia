I'm just writing story until I learn what I need of Python.

[TRACK] everyday pleasantries
[CG] Marine bio lab, detail isn't important here, go wild as long as it looks like what it's supposed to
[SFX] bubbles (fishtanks)
[narrator] Another comfortable day. And they told me life in America would be hard.
[SCENE] random coworker enters, doesn't matter what he looks like
[coworker] Oi, (protagonist), boss wants to see you.
[protagonist] Alright, on my way.
...
[CG] stairway, then office, perfectly neat, with harsh white lighting
[protagonist] You wanted to see me, sir?
[SCENE] Stout, portly man, small moustache, dressed in a lab coat over a button-down with a tie and slacks,  cheerful expression
[boss] Ah, (protagonist), yes. I have a... request to make.
You see, the team down in California is undermanned, and -
[protagonist] Stop stop stop. The answer's no. I hate hot weather more than anything.
[boss] I figured you'd say that.
